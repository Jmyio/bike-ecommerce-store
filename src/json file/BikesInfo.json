The feeling of a bike this light and efficient is unbeatable, and this instant acceleration, vibration absorption and responsive handling come from a frame which knows where it needs to be light and where it needs to be stiff. Welcome the ultimate climbing machine!",
            "description2" : "Historically, considering only the three design factors of aerodynamics, stiffness and weight rarely yeilds dramatic improvement. Big gains in one area always compromise one or both of the others. The key to building the best aero road bike is finding the balance of these targets, and identifying additional performance factors that allow the rider to increase efficiency.",

Ever since it made its debut more than 20 years ago as a controversial race bike with compact geometry and a radical new look compared to all other race bikes of that era, the TCR has continually pushed the limits of performance. It has been a staple in the pro peloton since 1998, earning wins at major races around the world for more than two decades.",
